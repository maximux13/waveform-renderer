title: Introduction
description: Waveform Renderer is a high-performance, lightweight TypeScript library for rendering audio waveforms on HTML5 Canvas. It provides developers with a simple yet powerful tool to create beautiful, interactive audio visualizations.
---

## What is Waveform Renderer?

Waveform Renderer is a specialized library focused exclusively on **waveform visualization**. Unlike full-featured audio libraries, it keeps things lean and efficient while embracing modern web standards.

Key characteristics:
- **Pure rendering focus** â€“ No audio playback, only visualization
- **Canvas-based** â€“ Hardware-accelerated rendering with smooth animations
- **TypeScript-first** â€“ Built from the ground up with type safety
- **Zero dependencies** â€“ Lightweight and fast to load

---

## Key Benefits

### âš¡ Performance First
- Intelligent caching to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized algorithms for large audio datasets
- Smart canvas management with pixel ratio handling
- Frame-rateâ€“friendly animations for smooth playback

### ðŸ’» Developer Experience
- Full TypeScript support with complete type definitions
- Intuitive, easy-to-learn API
- Clear documentation with practical examples
- 200+ unit tests ensuring reliability

### ðŸŽ¨ Highly Customizable
- Full control over visual appearance
- Advanced customization via render hooks
- Support for custom renderers to fit unique needs
- Responsive design with automatic resizing

## When to Use Waveform Renderer

Choose Waveform Renderer if you need:
- **Audio visualization** in music players or audio editors
- **Waveform displays** for podcasts and voice recordings
- **Interactive audio UIs** with seek functionality
- **Custom visualizations** tailored to your design system
- **Performance-critical solutions** where speed is essential

---

## Architecture Overview

The library is built on a **modular architecture**:
- **Renderer** â€“ Core component managing the canvas and interactions
- **RenderingEngine** â€“ Handles drawing and performance optimizations
- **Hooks system** â€“ Provides customization points for developers

---

## âœ… Verification

After installation, you can quickly verify that Waveform Renderer is working with a minimal example:

```typescript
import { WaveformRenderer } from "waveform-renderer";

// Create a canvas element
const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = 600;
canvas.height = 200;
document.body.appendChild(canvas);

// Example mock peak data
const mockPeaks = new Array(200).fill(0).map((_, i) => Math.sin(i / 10));

// Initialize the renderer
const renderer = new WaveformRenderer(canvas, mockPeaks, {
  color: "#3b82f6",
});

// You should now see a simple waveform on the canvas ðŸŽ‰
````

If the waveform appears, your setup is complete.
